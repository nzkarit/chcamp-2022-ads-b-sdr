## ChCamp 2022 - ADS-B workshop
This repo contains instructions and links for [my](https://twitter.com/nzkarit) workshop at [ChCamp](https://2022.chcon.nz/trainers/dave/) 2022. It leverages [my fork of ADSB-Out](https://github.com/nzkarit/ADSB-Out) code which was originally written by [lyusupov](https://github.com/lyusupov/ADSB-Out).

The [setup.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/chcamp-2022-ads-b-sdr/blob/master/setup.md) file is how to get everything installed. I am planning to bring pre built VM, so these are for reference and shouldn't be needed during the workshop. Though you can use these build your own VM

The [running.md](https://github.com/nzkarit/chcamp-2022-ads-b-sdr/blob/master/running.md) file contains all the commands etc which will be helpful during the workshop, so you can copy and paste and not have to read from projector.

For ChCamp I have put a [preconfigured VM]() up which is ready to go (basically everything from setup.md) if you would like to use that. It will disappear sometime after the con.

If you have an RTLSDR you can do the listening parts and with a HackRF you can do the broadcast parts.
